This is a simple Hello world Angular application with Rust WASM.

To run the app:
* You need to have [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed  
* Run `wasm-pack build` in the wasm folder. This will generate the wasm/pkg folder
* Run `npm install`  
* Run `ng serve` to start the app on localhost

When you open the app in your browser, you should see an alert generated by WASM called from ngOnInit.
